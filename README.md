# assessment-front-end

### Tech Stack

Added libraries:

-isomorphic-fetch -> library for management of API calls.

redux, react-redux -> for the use of a 'decentralized' state, detached from the components

thunk -> integration of redux with asynchronous functions. (Call API).

enzyme, enzyme-adapter-react-16 -> for testing purpose

styled-components -> for keeping track of which components are rendered on a page and injects their own styles 

selector -> to avoid duplicated data in Redux, and this is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.
